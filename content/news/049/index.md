Welcome to the 49th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

### Oort

![A fleet of ships in Oort](oort.png)

[Oort] ([GitHub], [Discord]) by [@rlane](https://github.com/rlane) is a programming
game where you write Rust code to control space ships in combat against other
players. Your code needs to manage the thrusters, guns, missiles, comms, and
radar of each ship in your fleet. There's a series of tutorials where you can
solve key problems one by one, such as leading moving targets or missile
guidance. The game runs in your browser via WebAssembly.

Oort has started running weekly tournaments and the AIs have gotten more and more
sophisticated each time. Check out this recent [tournament
writeup](https://github.com/rlane/oort3/wiki/Tournament-Writeup-2023%E2%80%9009%E2%80%9011)
where the top players discuss their strategies.
